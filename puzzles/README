Humans who write crossword puzzles often use standard grids.  The
grids in this directory are all standard -- one was copied from People
magazine, and the rest are from an existing puzzle generator.

For your enjoyment, here are many more grids of varying size 
and difficulty:

These grids have been used for many puzzles, so presumably there are
many ways to fill them out.  Even a human can fill them out, so a
computer should be able to do so too.  

On the other hand, human crossword writers generally use a very big
dictionary -- 150,000 to 1,000,000 words, including many weird little
words and even acronyms.  That helps them get out of tight corners.
The "words" file we gave you for this assignment only has 20,000
words.  We don't know which of the hard grids are actually SATisfiable
with the small dictionary, and which are UNSATisfiable.
